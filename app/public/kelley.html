    <h5><b>The Kelley School offers a top-tier business education focused on guiding you toward your own true success.</b></h5>
    
    <h5>At the Kelley School of Business, we are in the business of creating career momentum. Our students have the talent to succeed, the humility to grow and the tenacity to persevere. That ﻿spirit—combined with an education that only the elite Kelley School can deliver—results in graduates with the knowledge and skills needed to meet new challenges, to make positive change possible and to contribute to their organizations from day one.</h5>
    <h5>We have our roots in the first business course offered at Indiana College in Bloomington in 1830. Indiana College grew to be Indiana University, and the School of Commerce and Finance, established in 1920, grew to be the Kelley School of Business. We’ve offered business courses on our Indianapolis campus since 1916, implemented executive education in 1952 and advance business education on a global scale. Our timeline showcases more than 100 years of business excellence. </h5><br>
